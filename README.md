WGU Capstone

This was the WGU Capstone for my final project. Unfortunatley, the database is missing, and I am unable to find it
(Orginally used a MYSQL database), so it needs to be redone. I've posted the Java code here for reference and prosperity.

This capstone allowed the user to add and customizse there very own Random Encounter Tables within the pathfinder Roleplaying Game.
The new things I learned from this program was using a third party API (for PDF writing).
